Implementation of synchronization primitives to implement a job scheduling and execution system. These jobs are submitted for execution and get scheduled according to the system's efficiency goals. The system being implemented handles a large volume of incoming jobs by using several admission queues to store jobs before they get scheduled into execution.

In this system, each job needs specific resources and must be granted exclusive access to those resources before it can execute. Once a job has access to its necessary resources, it completes its execution and relinquishes access to them.
